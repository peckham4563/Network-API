# Network-API

## Description
This challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Part of the criteria was to build an API for the social network that uses a NoSQL database so that the website can handle large amounts of data. This challenge used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
